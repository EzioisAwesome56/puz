# PUZ: Quickbasic game
This was originally written in QuickBasic 4.5 for MS-DOS, then ported to QB64 for Windows builds.<br><br>

for ease of testing, all new maps will be created and tested with the DOS version of puz, found in the DOS folder. This is due to my garbage map loading via CHAINing .bas files containing map data.<br><br>

if you wish to create your own maps for use with the game, please run MAPEDIT.BAS in the DOS folder from either QB64 or QuickBasic 4.5. Once you have drawn out the map, type "save" to save the map. This will produce a file that can be easily loaded into the DOS version of PUZ. Loading the map into the QB64 version will be a tad harder, requriing editing of callMapLoad from the main .bas file<br><br>

this program has NOT been tested with qbasic, please use QuickBasic 4.5 for the best compatibility
